# Vowel Unmasking: Data

([stack](assets/data_stack.png))


## Original
Original data files generated by GoFerret at the time of the experiment


## Temperatures
Original temperature records made during experiments, as well as formatted versions that are more convenient to work with, and summary tables that bring together all records.


## Summary
CSV files directly taken from 'behavior' table in .mat files in Cross-referenced Behavior. These .mat files have now been removed from the repo (as we're trying to move towards fully open source data), but the cross-referencing was originally performed in Matlab ([script](Results/matlab_utils/step2_crossref_temp_and_behavior_spatialUnmask.m))


## Analysis
Filtered versions of summary data in which pre-processing (e.g. removing correction trials, ensuring attenuation levels are matched between conditions etc.) has been done by  [summary_to_analysis_data.py](summary_to_analysis_data.py)
