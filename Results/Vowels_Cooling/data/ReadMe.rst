1. Original
--------------
These are the text files generated by the data acquisition system, without any tidying up. They're ugly and inconvenient to work with, so we combined the files into something more user friendly....

---------------
2. Summary
---------------
These csv files contain information from all trials in the original data. They're the best starting place if you have your own analyses that you want to try, but they also contain columns that are specific to the animal / method used and therefore not that user friendly for the final statistical analysis. This data also contains all trials without filtering, whereas our final analysis removes things like correction trials or sound attenuations with small trial numbers.

3. Analysis
------------

This is the specific data used in the paper, which can be used to replicate that work. However these tables only contain a subset of the data and so if you want to try your own models, you may be better off with the summary data.
