# Temperature Monitoring

Cooling loop temperatures were measured by thermocouples placed on the implanted loop, and measured separately in left and right auditory cortex at regular intervals using proprietary software (Omega). The software generate text files for each session with timestamps and temperature measurements. 

It was then necessary to cross-reference these timestamps with the times of behavioral trials to get the cortical temperature at the time of sound presentation. This was important as temperature could vary within a session - either intentionally when loop temperature was gradually decreased during testing (F1509) or when the system failed to maintain the required temperature (usually because of a leak in the system that required pump rates to be lowered, or more often stopped).
