# Sound Localization Results

Analysis of sound localization results is divided into three views of the data:

## Full sound localization

This is the main analysis presented in the manuscript that shows the effect of cooling on ability to localize sounds presented from one of many speakers. The behavioral responses of ferrets are considered as they were made. The main figure (Fig. 3 in the manuscript) showing performance for each animal by sound location is generated by [localization_cooling_analysis.py](localization_analysis.py) and saved in [images](./images/localization.png). Statistical analysis is performed in [R](localization_stats.R) and console output is save to [localization_stats_report](./reports/localization_stats_report.txt).


## Sound lateralization
A simpler look at the data from sound localization above, but only considering whether animals made a response on the correct side of (left/right) space. A similar data visualization script generates a supplementary figure showing lateralization performance ([script](lateralization_supplementary.py) and [figure](./images/lateralization.png)), and statistical assessment are repeated under these simpler conditions ([script](lateralization_stats.R) and [console output](./reports/lateralization_stats_report.txt)).

## Left vs. Right discrimination
A further reduced view where only responses and stimuli presented from ±90° (i.e. left and right) were considered. Here, we've only repeated the data visualization step: ([script](left_vs_right_supplementary.py) and [figure](./images/left_vs_right.png))
