## Get started

### 1. Read the paper
Available on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.16.468798v3) (also accepted at the Journal of Neuroscience - coming soon).

### 2. Explore the notebooks
Most of the major analyses of the effects of auditory cortical inactivation are outlied in specific notebooks (links to pdfs for browser, but Rmarkdown files are available in the same directories and best viewed in Rstudio):
* [Vowel discrimination in clean vs. noisy conditions](https://github.com/stephentown42/cooling_auditory_cortex/blob/main/Results/Vowels_Cooling/R_stats/vin_cooling.pdf)
* Spatial separation of vowel and noise
* Sound localization
  - [Bilateral inactivation](https://github.com/stephentown42/cooling_auditory_cortex/blob/main/Results/Localization/R_stats/bilateral_GLMM_analysis.pdf)
  - [Unilateral inactivation](https://github.com/stephentown42/cooling_auditory_cortex/blob/main/Results/Localization/R_stats/unilateral_GLMM_analysis.pdf)

### 3. See the code
Divided into seperate directories for the different parts of the project

### 4. Use the data yourself
Summary data files are included as part of the repository. Clone and use the results to go further!
