## Get started

### 1. Read the paper
Available on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.16.468798v3) (also accepted at the Journal of Neuroscience - coming soon).

### 2. Explore the notebooks
Most of the major analyses of the effects of auditory cortical inactivation are outlied in specific notebooks (best viewed in Rstudio):
* Vowel discrimination in clean conditions
* Vowel discrimination in noise
* Spatial separation of vowel and noise
* Sound localization
  - Bilateral inactivation
  - [Unilateral inactivation](https://github.com/stephentown42/cooling_auditory_cortex/blob/main/Results/Localization/R_stats/unilateral_GLMM_analysis.pdf)

### 3. See the code
Divided into seperate directories for the different parts of the project

### 4. Use the data yourself
Summary data files are included as part of the repository. Clone and use the results to go further!
