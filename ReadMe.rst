Abstract
----------
Hearing in noise is critical for many species, where processes such as neural adaptation may allow listerners to discriminate degraded sounds.

Here we ask how noise affects the ability of ferrets to discriminate vowel sounds, demonstrating that for all animals, performance is worse when sounds are masked by noise. We then used the behaving ferret as a model in which to inactivate / record from brain areas.

Using reversible inactivation via cooling, we identified a critical role for auditory cortex in vowel discrimination in noise but not in clean conditions (i.e. without noise). In the same animals, cooling also impaired sound localization, indicating a common contribution of this brain region to spatial and non-spatial hearing.

Finally, we recorded the activity of single and multi-units in auditory cortex of ferrets during behaviour to determine how noise affected representations of vowel identity. Although individual units were found that showed noise-invariance (measured by our ability to decode sound identity from spiking responses), these units could not account for the behavior of listeners. Instead responses across the auditory cortical population more closely matched the decline in vowel discrimination at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), with a notable role for units tuned to high-frequencies that responded to noise but not target vowels, and whose choice-related activity was also linked to poor task performance. Continuous noise exposure suppressed responses in such units, and was associated with improved decoding of sound identity.
