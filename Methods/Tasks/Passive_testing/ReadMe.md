# Passive Testing


### Level 84


### Level 85


### Level 86
Stimulus onset asynchronies in which:
- noise precedes vowels (soa = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 or 3.2s)
- noise is presented at the same time (soa = 0s) 
- noise is presented with a delay (soa = -0.1s)
All stimulus were followed by a period of silence (i.e. no stimulus) at least equal in duration to stimulus presentation to allow cells to dishabituate. Vowels were /e/ or /u/
